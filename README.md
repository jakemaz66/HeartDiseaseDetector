# HeartDiseaseDetector
A logistic regression classifier to predict the health of a patient with heart disease. This project seeks to predict whether a patient is sick or healthy based on 13 features, lincluding age, sex, cholesterol, and more. 

The data was retrived from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, from the datset titled 'Heart Disease'. The link to this dataset can be found here:https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease

The data was converted into CSV format, cleaned, encoded, and then trained on a logistic regression model found within the scikit learn library. The model was then evaluated for effectiveness and used to predict single outcomes based on an input of a patient's features.
